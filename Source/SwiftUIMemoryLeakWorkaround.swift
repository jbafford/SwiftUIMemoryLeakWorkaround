/// A manager class for working around SwiftUI in iOS 17 leaking classes passed into a sheet or fullScreenCover presentation.
///
/// Present your root SwiftUI view from a `UIHostingController`, with a new `SwiftUIMemoryLeakWorkaround` added to the enviromennt:
///
/// ```
/// let workaround = SwiftUIMemoryLeakWorkaround()
/// view
/// 	.environment(\.swiftuiLeakWorkaround, workaround)
/// ```
///
/// After creating the coordinator, set its `controller` to the `UIViewController` that will contain your SwiftUI view.
/// Note that the controller is not provided in init to allow for two-phase initialization, such as is required when the
/// SwiftUI view is defined in an `init` method of a `UIHostingController` subclass.
///
/// In your SwiftUI views, replace calls to `.sheet` and `.fullScreenCover` with `.leak_workaround_sheet` and `.leak_workaround_fullScreenCover`.
///
/// The `item` provided to `.leak_workaround_sheet` and `.leak_workaround_fullScreenCover` must be
/// `Equatable` (in addition to `Identifiable`). This is because the workaround uses `.onChange(of:)` to detect changes,
/// and that view modifier requires `Equatable`.
///
/// Prior to iOS 17, or if the `\.swiftuiLeakWorkaround` environment key is not set, or set to `nil`, the workaround will have
/// no effect, and SwiftUI's sheet or fullScreenCover will be called. If the memory leak is fixed, in your application code,
/// you can then test for this fixed version of iOS and either not set the key, or set it to `nil`.
